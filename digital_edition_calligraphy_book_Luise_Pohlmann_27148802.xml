        <head>Editorial Introduction</head>
        <p>This editorial introduction will cover both important information on the history, the content, and the context of the manuscript, as well as the principles that guided the 
        creation of this edition. The introduction is divided into four parts, and covers the topics: editorial principles, the author, background to the original publication, and content and sources. </p>
          <div type="The Author" xml:id="ed_int_1" resp="editor">
            <head>The Author</head>
            <p><persName>John Scottowe</persName> (d.<date>1607</date>), also known as "the writing master of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>" was a <occupation>calligrapher and schoolmaster</occupation> (Backhouse 1974). He is the author of multiple alphabet books with ornate capitals. 
              As a penman and teacher in <placeName>England</placeName> during the reign of <persName>Elizabeth I</persName>, his books include edifying or practical passages of text written for schoolchildren. Only two of his manuscripts have survived, one being the here discussed 
              Chicago, Newberry Library, VAULT Wing MS ZW 545 .S431. The other, London, British Library, Harleian Ms. 3885, is similar in design and content but features different illuminations of the initials.
            </p>
          </div>
    
          <div type="background" xml:id="ed_int_2" resp="editor">
            <head>Background to the Original Publication</head>
            <p> 
              The Newberry alphabet book was published in <date>1592</date> as the adendmum on the verso of <locus>folio 24</locus> indicates. Next to the date on this folio, there is also the author's declaration: "per me Johannem Scottowe" written in Gothic script in a banner.
              The manuscript has no title page but instead starts immediately with the letter A, the contemporary binding that may have contained a title page is lost and the book is bound in a modern leather binding with paper flyleaves. The manuscript was presumably written in <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, as 
              this is where <persName>John Scottowe</persName> lived and worked. Additionally, there are hints to places around Norwich throughout the manuscript.             
              Located at the East coast of <placeName>England</placeName>, <placeName>Norwich</placeName> was an important centre for commerce in the Middle Ages, while also boasting a vibrant religious life. The city was second in importance to <placeName>London</placeName> in the <date>13th and 14th century</date>.
              The wealth generated by the wool trade throughout the Middle Ages financed the construction of many fine churches. During the reign of <persName>Elizabeth I.</persName>, the city saw an influx of immigrants mainly from the Low Countries (Encyclopedia Britannica. 2025). 
              This era also saw an increase in the number of children that received a formal education, although schools were still reserved for those who were able to pay for tuition (Cartwright 2020). It is likely that <persName>John Scottowe</persName> taught in a 
              preparatory school (also known as ABC, alphabet or 'petty' school). Here children learned the alphabet and communal reading. Only when they had mastered these skills did they move on to mathematics. Teachers, like <persName>John Scottowe</persName>, had few materials to help them in their work.
              Often they would create their own alphabet cards, and the Newberry manuscript may have been used in this way. However, the intricately designed initials are too ornate to have been designed only for use in school. It is more likely that the work was created as a demonstration of <persName>Scottowe's</persName>
              expert penmanship. It may also have been used as a pattern book, which other scribes copied from when creating luxury books. For example, <persName>Scottowe's</persName> books may have been used in the creation of five-volume partbook set Oxford, Bodleian Library, Mss. Mus.e.1–5. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div type="Content" xml:id="ed_int_3" resp="editor">
              <head>Content and Sources</head>
              <p> Pattern books like this manuscript were common in the Middle Ages as they were at once the blueprint, which scribes copied from, and a display of an artist's or workshop's skills, which could be shown to potential patrons. Books such as <persName>Scottowe's</persName>
                  at once helped their owners to learn different scripts and imparted moral instruction. His style "hearkens back to Burgundian manuscripts of the late fifteenth century" (Backhouse 1974). Living under the rule of <persName>Queen Elizabeth I.</persName>, <persName>Scottowe</persName> 
                  honours the Queen by listing her official titles on <locus>folio 15r</locus> next to the initial "Q". The illuminations contain further references to the time period, for example, the "Q" in the Newberry manuscript and the letter "T" in the British Library manuscript contain an image of the 
                  Elizabethan clown <persName><name>Richard Tarleton</name> <name type="variant">Richard Tarlton</name></persName>depicted with his drum. <persName>Tarleton</persName> was a member of the Queen’s Men (also called The Queen’s Players, Queen Elizabeth’s Men, or The Queen’s Majesty’s Players) 
                  at court. He was presumably quite popular as following his death caused by the plague in <date>1588</date>, multiple songs were written in his memory. <persName>Scottowe</persName> must have copied the illustration from a woodcut, used to illustrate a broadside ballad, but today only <persName>Scottowe's</persName> 
                  copy remains (Pittaway 2021). <br/>
                  Some of the text passages end abruptly, and the sentences remain unfinished. This may be because <persName>Scottowe</persName> wanted to adhere to his layout and not let the number of lines per page vary to much. It also shows that these proverbs may have been well-known at the time of writing. 
                  Presumably, the reader would be able to finish the sentence themselves. Although I was unable to find any of the passages online, it is plausible that <persName>Scottowe</persName> copied them from another contemporary book.

                  This digital edition was edited using TEI-XML, as it is the current standard for digital editions. TEI-XML gives great flexibility and allows for an infinite number of details. For this transcription 
                  I chose a diplomatic transcription style, as I wanted to find a balance between making the text more accessible for people not versed in Medieval English handwriting and staying true to the original.

                <head>Letter Forms and Abbreviations</head>
                <p>
                  As it was common for scribes to be versed in Latin in the Middle Ages, it is not uncommon that the language of the text passages on each folio alternates between English and Latin. 
                  There are two letters in Medieval English that are two different characters today. Firstly, in the <date>16th century</date> there was no difference between the letters I and J. J was often used for capitals 
                  and i in the middle of words. Secondly, the letters u nd v were also considered the same (Cartwright 2020). In this manuscript, some of the scripts have separate letter forms for u and v, 
                  although these scripts use them interchangeably. Other scripts do not differentiate at all using only one letterform (mostly u). In both cases, I have tried to increase legibility by transcribing the letters in their modern spellings 
                  but marking the places in which I made changes. I have also chosen to spell out abbreviations. For example, a p with a line in the descender is an abbreviation of per. In the scripts of the manuscript, there are hardly any ligatures 
                  as each letter is carefully spaced equidistantly to its neighbours, in the few cases where there are ligatures they have been marked and expanded.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div type="Editorial_Principles_hands" xml:id="ed_int_4_3" resp="editor">
                <head>Hands and Initials</head>
                <p>
                  A key component of the original manuscript is the multitude of different hands and the beautifully illuminated initials on each folio. In this edition, I wanted to pay tribute to the many different styles of script 
                  <persName>Scottowe</persName> writes so masterfully. As the hands are one of the key features of the alphabet book I note the hand used for each part of the text. Additionally, each hand is
                  described in the handDesc in the header of this edition. For all hands a palaeographical description has been provided, as sometimes the same text type (i.e. Gothic script) can be executed very differently 
                  and naming conventions such as "court hand" did not prove sufficient to accomodate the variantions in hands. <persName>Janet Backhouse</persName> in her edition of two of <persName>Scottowe's</persName>
                  alphabet books identified the scripts in the work as "accomplished specimens of contemporary scripts, italic, roman, secretary, court, and some more purely decorative text hands" (Backhouse 1974, 5). I follow her classification
                  but also provide descriptions of the scripts she has grouped as decorative hands.<br/>

                  The main element of the alphabet book, the illuminated initials, are hardly done justice by their transcription as a single letter. To better show their size on the page and their importance, I split the page into two columns, 
                  allowing the initials to take up the entirety of the left column, as they do in the original manuscript. While this is closer to the original layout of the manuscript, it cannot fully capture the way the initials surround the text on 
                  the page often stretching into the right-hand side column at the top and bottom of the page. Therefore, I provide links to the facsimile pages on the Newberry Library's website, allowing readers to easily navigate the facsimile and view the original illuminations.

                In this edition, all places and persons are marked. Whenever possible, I have tried to provide additional information on the persons and places mentioned in the form of footnotes.
                The additional information supplied in these notes varies from contextual knowledge, which supplies information in the context of the manuscript, linking folios to each other
                and bibliographical information, which gives interesting insights into the time period in which the manuscript was produced.
